%PERFPROF Produce performance profile.
% [th_max, h] = PERFPROF(A,th_max) produces a
% peformance profile for the data in the M-by-N matrix A,
% where A(i,j) > 0 measures the performance of the jâ€™th solver
% on the i-th problem, with smaller values of A(i,j) denoting
% "better". For each solver theta is plotted against the
% probability that the solver is within a factor theta of
% the best solver over all problems, for theta on the interval
% [1, th_max].
% Set A(i,j) = NaN if solver j failed to solve problem i.
% TH_MAX defaults to the smallest value of theta for which
% all probabilities are 1 (modulo any NaN entries of A).
% h is a vector of handles to the lines with h(j)
% corresponding to the j-th solver.
